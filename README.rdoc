= dotfiles
These are some of the files I use to configure my system.

== installation
See warning.
  git clone git://github.com/adambair/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles

== environment
I currently use Mac OS X (Snow Leopard - 10.6)

== todo
Write a rake task to create all of the necessary symbolic links.

== warning
My dotfiles are kind of a mess right now and should only be used as reference. I'll remove this warning once I refactor.
